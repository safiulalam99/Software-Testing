# Software Testing

This project focuses on software testing and validation for a collection of simple Python classes. The purpose of this project is to ensure the correctness and reliability of the implemented classes, covering a variety of functionalities such as arithmetic operations, date manipulations, and data structure management.

## Prerequisites

Before you run the tests, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Python 3.6 or higher (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## No Package Installation Required
We use Python's in-built test library unittest to write the test cases. Therefore no additional packages are required.

## Project Overview

- ArithmeticOperations - performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- BankAccount - simulates a simple bank account with deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry functionalities.
- BasicStatistics - calculates basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation for a given set of numbers.
- DateManipulations - handles date-related operations, like date validation, adding or subtracting days, and comparing dates.
- GeometryCalculations - computes areas and perimeters of various geometric shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles.
- ListManager - manages and manipulates lists, offering operations like adding, removing, and searching elements.
- Queue - implements a basic Queue data structure with enqueue, dequeue, and is_empty functionalities.
- Stack - implements a basic Stack data structure with push, pop, and is_empty functionalities.
- StringFormatting - formats strings using various methods like capitalization, lowercasing, and title casing.
- StringManipulation - performs string manipulations like reversing, replacing, and finding substrings.

## Running the Tests

To run all tests, navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
`python testSuiteAll.py`
All the tests for the 10 classes are defined in the `testSuiteAll.py` file.


## Test Suite

The test suite includes tests for the following classes:

The test suite includes tests for the classes listed above. Each class has its own test module in the form `TestClassname.py`.
